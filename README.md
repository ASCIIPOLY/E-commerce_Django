# E-commerce_Django
E-commerce site with django,bootstrap and javascript

### Description
As a product sales site, I developed an e-commerce site where both users
and non-users can purchase products, add their products to the basket and
check the products in the basket. However, cookies are used to prevent
non-user information from being deleted when renewed.

### python manage.py runserver
for running server

### python manage.py createsuperuser
for creating super user and accessing admin panel
